# EStore

This project is part of a school assignment where we implement both database management and a REST API for an e-commerce system. The solution is divided into two main parts: creating a REST API and developing a frontend application using Blazor to interact with the API.

The frontend, developed using Blazor Server, allows users to interact with the API to manage products, customers and orders.

## Features

- **Product Management:** Create, update, delete, and mark products as discontinued in the database.

- **Customer Management:** Register customers, update their information, and search for customers by email.

- **Order Management:** Track products purchased by customers, create orders and search orders by customer email.

## Technologies Used

### Languages Used

- [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)) - The main programming language for both the backend API and frontend application.
- [CSS](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) - Used for styling the frontend Blazor application.
- [HTML](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) - Markup language used for the structure of the frontend pages.

### Frameworks, Libraries, Tools & Programs

- [Blazor Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/hosting-models?view=aspnetcore-8.0#blazor-server) - Used for building the interactive frontend that communicates with the REST API.
- [Microsoft.AspNetCore](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore/) - Provides essential libraries and middleware for building web applications, including support for RESTful APIs.
- [Microsoft.NETCore](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) - The core framework used for building the application.
